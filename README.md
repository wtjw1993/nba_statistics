# nba_stats_eda
Exploratory data analysis of NBA player stats using python. This process is to build up towards building a logistic regression model for predicting whether or not a player is going to be on any of the All-NBA teams given their per game stats in a season.

The data was downloaded from Open Source Sports at http://www.opensourcesports.com/basketball/. Currently, only data from basketball_players.csv and basketball_awards_players.csv have been used.
