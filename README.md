# analysing_nba_stats
Exploratory data analysis of NBA player stats using python. This process will lead towards building a logistic regression model for predicting whether or not a player is going to receive an award based on their stats for the season.

The data was downloaded from Open Source Sports at http://www.opensourcesports.com/basketball/. Currently, only data from basketball_players.csv and basketball_awards_players.csv have been used. No team statistics have been included in the analysis at this point.
